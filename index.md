# The Econometrics of Inequality Sensitive Treatment Effect Estimation

Decision-makers increasingly require robust insights into how interventions affect diverse populations. Traditional analyses often overlook distributional effects or lack a coherent economic framework for proper evaluation. The EquiStat Lab addresses this critical gap by developing sophisticated statistical methodologies that precisely measure and characterize distributional impacts across interventions, firmly grounded in modern welfare economic theory. Our approach integrates efficiency considerations and equity concerns into a unified analytical framework, enabling more comprehensive and nuanced policy evaluations that capture the full spectrum of societal impacts from interventions and other policy tools.

This material is based upon work supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) under [Grant # 2313969](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2313969). **Principal Investigator**: [Eduardo Zambrano](https://eduardo-zambrano.github.io/).

The research program consist of three main research projects.[^a]

## Project 1: Protected income and inequality aversion
The [first component](../protected-income/), written in collaboration with [Marc Fleurbaey](https://sites.google.com/site/marcfleurbaey/Home), involves developing a methodology for determining an evaluator's social preferences based on the tradeoffs between the well-being of different individuals that the evaluator considers acceptable. **The paper for this project is now complete, and it is available [at this link](https://osf.io/tnu2q/)**.

## Project 2: Social preferences under uncertainty and ambiguity
The [second component](../uncertainty-and-ambiguity/) involves incorporating this social welfare information into a statistical estimation framework, using an egalitarian equivalent representation of the evaluator's preferences, a concept akin to the certainty equivalent representation in expected utility theory.

## Project 3: Inequality sensitive optimal treatment assignment
The [third component](../treatment-assignment/) involves applying this framework to the analysis of optimal treatment rules in randomized controlled trials, using Bayesian, maximin, and minimax regret criteria, and testing the developed methodologies on several well-known trials that exhibit considerable treatment effect heterogeneity. Interventions that exhibit treatment effect heterogeneity can be difficult to evaluate and summarize in terms of welfare. The methods developed in this project provide specific, quantitative guidance for how to do this evaluation. **The paper from this project is now complete, and it is available [at this link](https://osf.io/wv5jt/)**.

## Stay tuned
The plan for website is for us to share code and examples that will assist the interested reader with the following tasks: (i) conducting simulations to assess the effectiveness of the statistical and econometric tools we create, (ii) estimating egalitarian equivalent treatment effects and determining optimal treatment rules using both experimental and observational data, and (iii) visualizing the core theoretical results achieved throughout our research.
